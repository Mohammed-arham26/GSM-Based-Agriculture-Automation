## Overview
A GSM-enabled system to automate irrigation and monitor agricultural equipment remotely, aimed at improving efficiency and reducing manual labor.

## Features
- Remote irrigation pump control via SMS
- Automatic irrigation based on soil moisture levels
- Real-time status updates to farmers
- Low water and electricity consumption

## Tools & Technologies
- Arduino microcontroller
- SIM900 GSM module
- Soil moisture sensors
- Embedded C
